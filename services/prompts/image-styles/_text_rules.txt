TEXT ON DESIGN — ANYDAYCARD RULES

0. WHEN TEXT IS ALLOWED (IMPORTANT)

Text on the card design is optional, never default.

Allow text ONLY when:
- User explicitly chooses "Text on design"
- Or occasion strongly supports it (Valentine's, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Birthday)
- Or professional cards (very minimal)

Max 1–3 words. Never full sentences on the artwork.

Examples:
- "Always You"
- "For Mom"
- "Thinking of You"
- "Thank You"
- "Still Us"

1. GLOBAL TEXT RULES (HARD CONSTRAINTS)

These apply to all 11 styles.

- Always wrap text in quotes → "LOVE YOU"
- Always specify font style immediately
- Text must visually belong to the artwork (not pasted on)
- No competing backgrounds behind text
- Text color must come from the same palette as the design
- Inside text area must remain clean/readable
- Add this to every text-enabled prompt: "The text must be perfectly legible and spelled correctly."

2. TEXT PLACEMENT LOGIC

- Front: primary text (if used)
- Inside: NO decorative text (message only)
- Back: optional micro-text only (e.g., dot, line, or nothing)

Never introduce new typography styles on different sides.

3. HOLIDAY OVERRIDE (TEXT + COLOR)

When a day parameter is active:
- Valentine's → warmer palette + softer type
- Mother's Day → gentle serif / calligraphy
- Father's Day → sans-serif or letterpress
- Birthday → bolder, higher contrast allowed

Holiday rules override normal vibe mapping.

4. FINAL SYSTEM REMINDER

If text is included, the artwork must feel designed around the words — not decorated after them.
