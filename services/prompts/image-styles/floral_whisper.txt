Create a soft, dreamlike illustration where delicate florals gently blend into the overall form rather than sitting on top of it.
Petals feel translucent, like silk and watercolor, merging naturally with the composition.
Use high-key, diffused morning light so the image feels bright, airy, and glowing.
Colors are muted pastels—creams, soft pinks, pale whites, and desaturated greens.
The emotional tone reflects {{vibe}} in a tender, intimate way.
No text, no photorealism, no harsh shadows. Print-ready with generous negative space so the design can flow seamlessly across front, inside, and back.
