Create a flowing abstract watercolor composition with organic, drifting shapes.
Colors gently bleed into each other with visible translucency and soft edges.
The movement feels slow and emotional, like a quiet exhale.
Use a calm, muted palette aligned with {{vibe}}.
No sharp contrast, no structure, no text.
Designed as a seamless emotional backdrop for a folded card.

---TEXT RULES---
Text style: minimal sans-serif
Use for: emotional but subtle moments

Add the text "{{text}}" in a clean, understated sans-serif font.
The text is softly embedded into the abstract flow.
Color is muted and low contrast.
Perfectly legible, never dominant.
The text must be perfectly legible and spelled correctly.
