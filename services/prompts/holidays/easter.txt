Emotional rule: renewal, lightness
Avoid: childish or overly playful visuals

Apply an Easter visual treatment.
Use light, fresh colors such as pale yellows, soft greens, gentle lilacs, and warm whites.
The composition should feel airy and open, with a sense of renewal.
Any seasonal references should be abstract and calm.
