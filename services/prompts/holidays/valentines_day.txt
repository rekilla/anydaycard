Emotional rule: intimacy > spectacle
Avoid: loud reds, clichés, novelty hearts

Apply a Valentine's Day visual treatment.
Use a warm, romantic palette of soft reds, blush pinks, creams, and gentle rose tones.
Lighting should feel intimate and close, like candlelight or late afternoon warmth.
Any romantic symbols must be abstract or subtle, never literal or cartoonish.
The overall feeling should be tender, personal, and emotionally close.
Restraint is more important than decoration.
