Emotional rule: respect, steadiness, grounded love
Avoid: sentimentality, florals, playful clutter

Apply a Father's Day visual treatment.
Use a grounded color palette of blues, charcoals, warm grays, deep greens, or earth tones.
The design should feel structured, calm, and confident.
Visual language should be minimal and restrained, avoiding decorative excess.
The emotion comes from simplicity and intention, not softness.
