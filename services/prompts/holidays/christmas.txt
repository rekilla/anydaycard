Emotional rule: warmth + calm nostalgia
Avoid: loud holiday kitsch, crowded scenes

Apply a Christmas visual treatment.
Use warm, cozy tones like deep greens, muted reds, creams, and soft gold accents.
Lighting should feel like evening glow or winter warmth.
Holiday references should be subtle and atmospheric, never literal or busy.
The mood is comfort, togetherness, and quiet tradition.
