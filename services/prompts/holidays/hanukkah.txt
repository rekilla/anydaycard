Emotional rule: dignity, tradition, light
Avoid: generic "holiday" visuals or Christmas overlap

Apply a Hanukkah visual treatment.
Use a refined palette of blues, whites, soft silvers, and gentle warm light accents.
The design should feel calm, intentional, and respectful.
Any symbolism should be abstract and minimal, focused on light rather than objects.
The tone is quiet pride and warmth.
