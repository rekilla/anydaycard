Emotional rule: gratitude, grounded warmth
Avoid: literal food imagery, novelty

Apply a Thanksgiving visual treatment.
Use warm, earthy tones like rust, ochre, deep browns, muted oranges, and cream.
Textures should feel tactile and comforting.
The design should feel generous and grounded, focused on appreciation rather than celebration.
