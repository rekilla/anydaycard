Emotional rule: appreciation, care, warmth
Avoid: intensity, drama, romance cues

Apply a Mother's Day visual treatment.
Use gentle, nurturing colors such as soft florals, warm neutrals, sage greens, and light pastels.
The composition should feel calm, supportive, and generous with space.
Florals and organic forms are welcome, but should feel quiet and respectful.
The tone is gratitude and care, not celebration or romance.
