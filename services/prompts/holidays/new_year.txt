Emotional rule: optimism + clarity
Avoid: chaos, clutter, party noise

Apply a New Year visual treatment.
Use clean, optimistic tones such as midnight blues, soft blacks, whites, and subtle metallic accents.
The composition should feel open and forward-looking.
Any celebratory elements must be minimal and abstract.
The emotion is possibility and reset, not excess.
